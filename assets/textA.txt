Wild.
Saturated.
Dripping in deep, oceanic intensity.
A majesty of multitudes,
A saviour apparition
Now wondrously real.
To see her lustrous form,
Curves and swells of refuge
For weary creatures and curious ones too
Hear the chatter of life she enlivens,
Algaes and fishes scamper in delight.
To bathe in the vibrancy of her colors,
And detail her rippling, oscillating fashion.
Never static, never stuck. Escaping through being,
An enrichment of riches for our sea-
And now on my floor.
To marvel at her majesty.
