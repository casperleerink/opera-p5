Sky and water fall towards each other 
As currents and torrents of force
Rip at Coral, who struggles to remain rooted
Against the vicious storm.
Ruthless winds whip and bruise her reef
Tugging at her limbs.
Corals bristles and buckles,
Wanting to remain under her Cloud 
Even as it pains her so.
The waters wonâ€™t let her stay.
She rebels against the tidal force that pulls her up and outward.
Violently,
She is ripped from her reef.
A weed, snatched
From the sea floor,
Catapulted far, far off
And plummeted in this dark, damp place.
Landing harshly on a coarse plane.
So very quickly
The winds dissemble,
Cloud has been lost, And Coral is found... inside Pantheon.
