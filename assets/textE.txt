Cloud, Cloud!
It’s getting much too hot. 
Her algae are leaving.
The fishes fewer, their choir quiet.
The sounds of her reef dulled by a dwindling number of dwellers.
They’ve stopped singing, they’ve stopped staying. 
Coral, weakened by this departure,
Cannot make her same appeal.
The rays bring out her
Brittleness,
Which cannot be undone.
Oh please Cloud! Why won't you appear?
Won't she see our resemblence
